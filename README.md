QuickRoutine (from the name Quick Sort :)) is lecture generating software for a semester. It generates optimized class schedule providing all the inputs and the constraints. Underneath it runs a cool maximum flow algorithm with a slightly modified DFS.

This software was developed for Shahjalal University of Science and Technology in Sylhet and was used multiple years successfully to generate the lectures.
